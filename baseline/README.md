# Baseline System for Determining Lexical Complexity

By Durk Betsema, Jantina Schakel, Leon Wetzel and Rik Zijlema

In order to run the baseline system, you need to provide which type of trial data you would like to use. You can specify this by entering either `-S` or `-M`.

Example usage would be:

```py -m main -S``` for single trial data

```py -m main -M``` for multi trial data
